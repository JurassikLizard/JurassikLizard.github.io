Recently, I've been working on a project called WebSH.
You can check out the repo for [WebSH](https://github.com/JurassikLizard/WebSH) and the [WebSH client](https://github.com/JurassikLizard/WebSHClient)

The main reason behind this project is to be able to access and develop on my machine remotely.
Currently there is only an SSH terminal using xterm.js and ssh2.
It looks something like this:
